# j124-seatrecline

I picked the question about seat recline because I have noticed it is a controversial debate amongst travelers. Some insist that it is rude/disrespectful to those sitting behind while others argue that the seat design builds in this functionality for a reason and that everyone has the option to do so. While a survey will not settle this subject, it is interesting to see where people in this survey stand on this matter.
